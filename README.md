# CS-250-Module-8-Journal
This is the Sprint Review and Retrospective from my final project.

Interpreting user needs starts with active listening, empathy, and translating goals into actionable features. In Agile, this is often done through user stories, which are short, structured descriptions of a feature from the user’s perspective. 
User stories help developers stay focused on user wants/needs, clarify acceptance criteria, and prioritize work based on customer impact. They also create collaboration between developers, product owners, and stakeholders by creating a shared language for requirements.
When I develop programs, I begin by clarifying the product, identifying user wants, and mapping out functionality. I prefer an iterative, feedback-driven approach, starting with a product goal and refining based on testing and user input. 
I aim to write maintainable code with clear documentation and intuitive UI/UX design. I also value peer reviews and retrospectives to continuously improve both the product and the process.
In future development work, I plan to incorporate a variety of different things I have learned throughout this course. (Sprint planning and backlog refinement to keep priorities clear and achievable, daily stand-ups for team alignment and quick issue resolution, 
retrospectives to reflect on what’s working and what needs improvement, acceptance criteria to ensure quality and clarity and User story mapping to visualize workflows and dependencies)
A good team member is collaborative, communicative, and adaptable. They respect diverse perspectives, contribute constructively to discussions, and support others in achieving shared goals. 
They take ownership of their work, respond well to feedback, and help create a culture of trust and continuous learning. In Agile teams, this also means being transparent about progress, blockers, and ideas for improvement.
